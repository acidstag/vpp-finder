# Post-Launch Improvements

## TODO (Immediate)

- [ ] **Set up email inbox for results@vppfinder.com.au** - Currently can send but not receive replies. Options:
  - Google Workspace ($6/mo)
  - Zoho Mail (free tier)
  - Forward to personal email via Namecheap email forwarding
  - Resend doesn't handle inbound - need separate solution

# Post-Launch Improvements

Analysis comparing VPP Finder to Compare the Market and industry best practices.
Saved for implementation after launch.

---

## Priority Actions (Post-Launch)

### 1. "Why Trust Us?" Section
Add to homepage/about page explaining:
- Independent comparison (not owned by any VPP provider)
- How we make money (affiliate disclosure, transparent)
- No cost to user
- Data privacy commitment

### 2. Email Nurture Sequence
Current: Send results email, done.

**Better: 3-5 email sequence over 2 weeks**

| Day | Email | Purpose |
|-----|-------|---------|
| 1 | Your personalized results | Deliver value |
| 3 | "Did you sign up yet?" | Nudge + highlight top match benefits |
| 7 | Earnings calculator breakdown | Show yearly potential for THEIR setup |
| 14 | "New programs/bonuses" | Re-engage with fresh content |

### 3. Personalized Savings Calculator
After results, show dynamic calculation:
> "Your [Battery Brand] in [Suburb] could earn **$1,047/year** with [Top Match]"

Make it feel calculated for THEM specifically, not generic numbers.

## What Compare the Market Does Well

### Social Proof
- "23 million comparisons" counter
- 4.4/5 customer rating with third-party badges
- Expert credibility (Head of Energy bio)
- Celebrity endorsement

### Meerkat Rewards (Retention Hook)
83% of comparison site users visit multiple sites. They solved this with ongoing rewards:
- 2-for-1 cinema tickets for a year
- 25% off dining, coffee, pizza

Transforms transactional comparison into ongoing relationship.

### Data Collection
Collect enough data to personalize future communications and cross-sell (insurance, broadband, etc.)

---

## Psychology Research

### Sunk Cost Fallacy
> "Once visitors begin completing a form and see progress indicators, they feel compelled to finish."

Multi-step forms convert **up to 214% better** than single-page forms.

**VPP Finder's 4-step calculator already leverages this well.**

### Intentional Friction = Quality Leads
Adding friction improved conversion rates by 1,100% in one case study. Only high-intent users complete multi-step flows.

### Key Stats
- 90% of users churn if they don't understand value within first week
- Progress bars increase completion by 22%
- Checklists make users 3x more likely to convert
- 78% want at least one human interaction option

## Gap Analysis

| Gap | Compare the Market | VPP Finder |
|-----|-------------------|------------|
| Social proof | "23M comparisons", reviews | None yet |
| Trust signals | Star ratings, partner logos | Minimal |
| Retention hook | Meerkat Rewards | None - one-and-done |
| Email nurture | Rich personalized campaigns | Basic capture |
| Human option | Phone support | Chat AI only |

## Future Considerations

### Add Battery Capacity Question
Currently missing. Battery size affects earnings significantly:
- Tesla Powerwall 2 = 13.5kWh
- Powerwall 3 = 13.5kWh but different specs
- Other batteries vary widely

### Retention Mechanism
VPP programs change rates/bonuses regularly.
Offer: "We'll notify you when better deals launch"
- Creates reason to capture email
- Gives reason to return

### Referral Program
"Share with a friend who has a battery"
- VPP users know other battery owners
- Natural word-of-mouth channel

### Tracking to Add
- Click-through rate on affiliate links
- Which programs get most clicks
- Email open/click rates
- Conversion from comparison to signup

---

## What VPP Finder Does Better

- **AI chat** - Unique, conversational, handles edge cases
- **VPP-specific expertise** - Niche they don't cover
- **Speed** - 2 minutes vs complex flows
- **No signup required** - Lower barrier to entry
