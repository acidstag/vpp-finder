## Template 2: Follow-up Email (1 week later)

**Subject:** Re: Partnership Inquiry - VPP Finder

Hi [Name/Team],

Just following up on my email from last week about a potential affiliate partnership.

To give you some context on the opportunity:
- We're seeing [X] visitors/month specifically looking for VPP programs
- Our comparison includes detailed information about [Provider Name]'s offering
- Users who click through are pre-qualified (they already have a compatible battery)

Happy to share our traffic data or jump on a quick 15-minute call.

## Template 3: Amber Electric (Has Public Affiliate Program)

**Note:** Amber has a public referral program. Go to https://www.amber.com.au/refer and check their partner program page.

**Subject:** Affiliate Partnership - VPP Comparison Site

Hi Amber Team,

I run VPP Finder, an independent comparison website for Australian VPP programs. We currently feature Amber SmartShift prominently in our recommendations.

I noticed you have a referral program - I'd like to discuss either:
1. Joining your standard referral program, or
2. A custom affiliate arrangement with tracking for our volume

VPP Finder uses AI to match battery owners with the best program for their setup. Amber often comes out on top for users who prefer wholesale pricing and full battery control.

Would love to chat about the best way to structure this.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with smaller providers** - Discover Energy, Diamond Energy, and GloBird are more likely to respond quickly and offer better terms

2. **Lead with value** - Show them traffic numbers and conversion potential

3. **Be specific about your audience** - "Pre-qualified battery owners actively looking for VPP programs" is valuable

4. **Offer data accuracy** - Providers appreciate sites that get their details right

5. **Consider exclusivity deals** - Some providers may offer better commissions for featured placement

6. **Follow up** - Most partnerships happen after 2-3 touches

## Commission Expectations

Based on industry standards:
- **Per-signup commission:** $50-150 per successful VPP enrollment
- **Lead generation:** $10-30 per qualified lead
- **Featured listing:** $200-500/month for premium placement

Start conservative and negotiate up as you prove value.
