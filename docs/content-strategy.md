## US Expansion Research

### Market Assessment

- US VPP market: 37.5 GW capacity (2025)
- 100,000+ Powerwalls in VPPs
- Tesla paid $9.9M to owners in 2024
- Key states: CA, TX, NY, MA (37% of market)

### Domain

- vppfinder.com: Available (Status:3 NXDOMAIN)
- Estimated cost: ~$12/year

### Monetization Reality

Lead gen is NOT a good fit because:
- VPP visitors already HAVE batteries
- Solar installers want people who want to BUY
- Audience mismatch

Better revenue model for US:
- Display ads (Ezoic → Mediavine path)
- Tesla referral credits
- Newsletter sponsorships
- Amazon affiliate (accessories)

### Earnings Projection (Ads Model)

| Year | Monthly Traffic | Revenue |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| 1 | 500 → 10,000 | $0 → $150/mo |
| 2 | 10,000 → 30,000 | $150 → $750/mo |
| 3+ | 50,000+ | $1,250 → $2,000/mo |

### Legal Requirements

- FTC disclosure required (prominent, near affiliate links)
- No US LLC needed initially
- Form as Australian business, consider LLC if >$50k/year

### AI Content Warning

Pure AI content unlikely to rank well in 2025 due to:
- Google E-E-A-T requirements
- March 2024 "scaled content abuse" update
- Need real experience/screenshots/opinions

Recommendation: Focus on AU first, prove model, then expand with US-based contributor.
